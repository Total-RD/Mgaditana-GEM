# Mgaditana-GEM

This directory contains datasets used for biomass objective functions composition.
iMgadit23 contains two independent BOFs, representing respectively biomass composition of WT and MgACSBG#31 mutant strains [(Billey et al. 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/185/3/815/6094630?login=false). Each biomass objective function involves 17 pseudo-reactions and pseudo-metabolites representing BIOMASS, the different macromolecules (DNA, RNA, PROTEINS, CARBOHYDRATES, PIGMENTS and LIPIDS) and glycerolipid classes (DAG, TAG, PC, PE, PI, PG, DGTS, DGDG, MGDG, SQDG). To facilitate their identification, all pseudo-reactions and associated pseudo-metabolites involved in the BOF were respectively tagged “WT526” and “MgACSBG31”. Detailed lipidomic profiles in terms of glycerolipid classes and acyl chains profiles of glycerolipids reported for “untransformed WT” and “MgACSBG#31” strains from [(Billey et al. 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article/185/3/815/6094630?login=false) were used to calculate lipid stoichiometric coefficients. Other stoichiometric coefficients of both BOFs are based on diverse experimental and literature data.
