# Mgaditana-GEM model

### Model
The model is available as .xml, .xlsx, .json, and .mat.

### Usage

If you want to use the model, any software that accepts SBML Level 3 Version 1 formatted model files will work. We recommend the following as they are well-maintained and used by most researchers in the constraint-based metabolic modeling community:
* MATLAB
  * [COBRA Toolbox](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox) and [RAVEN Toolbox](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN)
* Python
  * [cobrapy](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy)

The [model](https://github.com/Total-RD/Mgaditana-GEM/model) and its [2D-Pathway Map](https://github.com/Total-RD/Mgaditana-GEM/map) are also provided in JSON format compatible with [Escher](https://escher.github.io/#/) and [Escher-FBA](https://sbrg.github.io/escher-fba/#/).
